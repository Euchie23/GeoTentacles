# 🗺️ GeoTentacles — Spatial Analytics for Marine Species, Pollution & Habitat Dynamics

## 🌍 **Real-World Value** 

GeoTentacles transforms marine biological, chemical, and environmental datasets into spatial intelligence.  
It reveals *where* marine patterns occur, *how* they evolve, and *what* environmental factors shape them — using PostgreSQL/PostGIS, machine learning, and GIS workflows.

This repo supports:
- Fisheries agencies: mapping catch hotspots, effort distribution, and long-term spatial trends  
- Marine ecologists: linking species patterns to environmental drivers  
- Environmental groups: monitoring pollution levels and identifying risk zones  
- Data scientists: learning practical spatial analytics, geodata engineering, and ML for geospatial prediction  

GeoTentacles is the spatial “mapping wing” of the broader **Squid_Fest ecosystem**, complementing:
- **SquidStack** — deep biochemical & pollutant bioindicator exploration  
- **SquidStock** — long-term catch, environment, and predictive modeling  
- **GeoTentacles** — *the spatial dimension*, stitching catch, pollution, and environmental layers into geographic context  

🛂 **This repository hosts spatial workflows, datasets, prototypes, and dashboards.  
The full research pipeline lives in the private Squid_Fest repo — email me for collaboration.**

## 🎯 Objectives

GeoTentacles aims to:

- Build reproducible spatial workflows for marine ecological datasets  
- Discover spatial hotspots of catch, pollution, and biological traits  
- Create predictive spatial models (classification + regression)  
- Generate continuous pollution surfaces via geostatistics  
- Construct composite health indices to support policy and management  
- Integrate catch + pollutant + environment geodata for multi-layer insights  
- Develop interactive dashboards for visualization and decision support

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

### **Spatial Database & Backend**
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS  
- Geometry & geography columns  
- Spatial indexing (GiST), tiling, grid creation
> Deployment Note:  
  While GeoTentacles was developed against a local PostgreSQL/PostGIS database, deployed
  dashboards were connect to a cloud-hosted PostgreSQL backend (NeonDB) to allow the
  same spatial SQL workflows to run in hosted environments without maintaining a local
  database server.


### **GIS Tooling**
- QGIS  
- GeoJSON, shapefiles, rasters, WMS layers  

### **Geospatial Python**
- geopandas  
- shapely  
- rasterio  
- pykrige / scikit-learn spatial ML  

### **Machine Learning**
- Classification: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost (grid-aggregated)  
- Regression: Random Forest Regressor, GAMs, Gradient Boosting  
- Spatial cross-validation (blocked CV)  

### **Dashboards**
- Streamlit (planned)  
- Mapbox / Leaflet (optional future expansion)
