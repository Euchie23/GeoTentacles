    "# Temporal Animation of Squid Fishing Hotspots (2000–2020)\n",
    "### Spatio-Temporal Shifts, EEZ Enforcement, and High-Seas Fishing in the Southwest Atlantic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project explores **spatio-temporal changes in squid fishing activity** in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean through an **animated GIF** generated from representative **QGIS map snapshots**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The animation uses four key years — **2000, 2010, 2011, and 2020** — selected to capture the **beginning, transitional phases, and end** of a 20-year squid catch dataset. These snapshots highlight **major spatial regime shifts** in fishing behavior and illustrate how fleets respond over time to **marine governance, enforcement capacity, and ecological dynamics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fishing hotspots are visualized alongside **Argentina’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)** boundaries, allowing direct comparison between vessel activity and maritime jurisdiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an EEZ?\n",
    "An **Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)** is a maritime area extending up to **200 nautical miles from a country’s coastline**, as defined under the **United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982)**. Within this zone, the coastal state has sovereign rights over natural resources, including fisheries. The red lines in the animated_hotspots.gif and the hotspots maps represent the EEZ boundaries the the countries within that region\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foreign vessels **cannot legally fish inside an EEZ without authorization**\n",
    "- Waters beyond the EEZ are considered **high seas**, where international fishing is permitted under international law\n",
    "\n",
    "**Argentina’s EEZ was already legally in place well before 2000.**  \n",
    "Therefore, observed changes in fishing behavior over time are best explained not by the creation of the EEZ, but by **changes in enforcement, surveillance, and compliance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations by Year\n",
    "### 🟢 2000 – Early Period: Weak Enforcement, High Access\n",
    "- Foreign fleets (including Taiwan and others not native to the Southwest Atlantic) appear fishing **close to Argentina’s continental shelf aand had extremely high CPUEs**\n",
    "- Although the EEZ existed legally, **monitoring and enforcement capacity was limited**\n",
    "- Fishing likely occurred:\n",
    "  - Just outside the 200-mile EEZ boundary, or\n",
    "  - In some cases, illegally inside the EEZ with low risk of interception\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern reflects early “**open access**” dynamics near EEZ edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟡 2010 – Transitional Period: Moving Offshore\n",
    "- Fishing activity becames less intense than previous years (lower CPUEs) and shifts **further offshore into deeper waters**\n",
    "- This likely corresponds with:\n",
    "  - Improved satellite monitoring (e.g., AIS),\n",
    "  - Increased naval and coast guard patrols,\n",
    "  - Growing international attention to Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**  \n",
    "The EEZ had not changed legally, but **enforcement had become more effective**, encouraging fleets to operate farther from the coast.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🟠 2011 – Spatial Shift Southward\n",
    "- Fishing effort appears to shift **southward toward the Falkland/Malvinas region**\n",
    "- This change likely reflects a combination of:\n",
    "  - Ecological factors (squid migration and stock dynamics),\n",
    "  - Continued pressure to avoid Argentina’s EEZ,\n",
    "  - Concentration of activity near politically complex or high-seas-adjacent zones\n",
    "\n",
    "This year highlights how **fishing fleets adapt spatially** in response to both biology and regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔵 2020 – Modern Pattern: EEZ Compliance at the Boundary\n",
    "- Foreign vessels concentrate fishing activity **right along the EEZ boundary**\n",
    "- Unlike earlier years, they **do not cross into Argentina’s EEZ**\n",
    "- This behavior is consistent with:\n",
    "  - Stronger surveillance and enforcement,\n",
    "  - Higher penalties and reputational risk,\n",
    "  - Better vessel tracking and international scrutiny\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern reflects the well-known “**Mile 201**” phenomenon, where fleets operate just outside national jurisdiction to legally access migratory species like squid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- The major change in squid catch locations can be due to:\n",
    "  - Enforcement capacity,\n",
    "  - Surveillance technology,\n",
    "  - Compliance behavior of international fleets\n",
    "- Squid fishing activity increasingly concentrates:\n",
    "  - Along EEZ boundaries,\n",
    "  - In high-seas zones adjacent to productive continental shelves\n",
    "\n",
    "The animated maps visually demonstrate how **policy, enforcement, and ecology intersect spatially** over two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "This project demonstrates:\n",
    "- **Geospatial storytelling** using temporal snapshots\n",
    "- Integration of **policy context** into spatial data analysis\n",
    "- Ability to infer **human behavior and governance effects** from spatial patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining GIS visualization with legal and environmental context, this analysis shows how data can be used to tell a compelling, real-world story about ocean governance and resource exploitation.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "This project uses an animated GIS visualization to examine how squid fishing hotspots in the Southwest Atlantic shifted between 2000 and 2020 in relation to Argentina’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). By comparing representative snapshots from key years, the analysis reveals a clear spatial transition: early fishing activity occurred close to the continental shelf with extremely high CPUEs, while later years show foreign fleets increasingly concentrating along the EEZ boundary without crossing into national waters with lower CPUEs. These patterns suggest that changes in enforcement capacity, surveillance, and regulatory compliance—rather than changes in EEZ law itself—played a major role in shaping fishing behavior. The project demonstrates how temporal geospatial analysis can be used to tell a compelling story about marine governance, human adaptation, and resource exploitation on the high seas."
