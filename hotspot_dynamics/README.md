# 🌊 Charting the Currents — 20-Year Spatio-Temporal Hotspot Analysis of Squid Catch

## 🧭 Problem Framing & Data Context
Long-term squid fisheries data often exhibit **high spatial and temporal variability**, complicating management and ecosystem-based planning. Traditional CPUE metrics are noisy, and vessel-level aggregation may obscure recurring hotspots.  

**Goal:** Identify **persistent and shifting fishing hotspots** over 20 years using spatial aggregation and polygon-based CPUE calculations, providing actionable intelligence for **regulatory compliance, ecological insight, and resource management**.

---

## 📘 Executive Summary
**What we did:**
Aggregated vessel-based catch events into origin-aligned 0.25° polygon grid cells, calculated yearly CPUE per cell, and visualized 20 years of squid fishing hotspots.  
**Main outcomes:**
- Hotspots shift geographically over time, reflecting ecological and regulatory patterns
- Peak catches concentrated in specific regions, especially during 2010–2011
- By 2020, fishing activity aligned with EEZ regulations

**Data scope:** 20-year dataset of vessel fishing events with spatial coordinates, environmental variables (SST, Chlorophyll-a), and catch volumes.

---

## 🌍 Real-World Value
This polygon-based aggregation allows **robust, interpretable hotspot detection**. It informs management, compliance, research, and advocacy.  

**Who This Helps:**
- Fisheries agencies: identify high-density fishing areas for monitoring
- Research labs: explore spatial and temporal patterns in cephalopod fisheries
- NGOs & policy teams: prioritize conservation and regulatory efforts

**Why It Matters:**  
By moving beyond raw CPUE metrics to polygon-level aggregation, the analysis reveals **consistent spatial patterns**, supports **evidence-based enforcement**, and facilitates **ecosystem-aware planning**.

---

## 🎯 Applied Use Case

This hotspot analysis is designed to support **spatially explicit fisheries decision-making** by revealing where squid fishing activity concentrates, how hotspots shift over time, and how management boundaries influence behavior.

### Example Applications

**1. Spatial Management & Enforcement**
Fisheries agencies can use yearly hotspot maps to:
- Identify consistently high-pressure fishing areas
- Allocate patrol and monitoring resources more efficiently
- Evaluate whether fishing effort shifts align with EEZ enforcement or regulatory changes

By comparing hotspot locations before and after regulatory milestones (e.g., post-2010 EEZ alignment), managers can assess compliance indirectly through spatial behavior.

**2. Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management**
Hotspot persistence and movement provide insight into:
- Core habitat use by *Illex argentinus*
- Interannual shifts driven by environmental variability or stock dynamics
- Regions where fishing pressure repeatedly overlaps with key ecological zones

This supports ecosystem-based planning beyond single-year CPUE metrics.

**3. Research & Survey Design**
Research groups can use hotspot outputs to:
- Prioritize regions for scientific surveys or tagging campaigns
- Compare spatial CPUE patterns with environmental drivers (SST, Chlorophyll-a)
- Design stratified sampling frameworks based on historical fishing intensity

**4. NGO & Policy Analysis**
Conservation organizations and policy teams can:
- Communicate long-term spatial fishing patterns to stakeholders
- Identify areas of recurring pressure that may warrant protection or monitoring
- Use visual hotspot evidence in policy briefs and advocacy materials

⚠️ Interpretation Note: Hotspots indicate historical fishing activity density. Not direct biomass. Use alongside ecological and regulatory indicators.

## 🧩 Module Overview
**Core Objectives**
- Aggregate catch into 0.25° × 0.25° polygon grid cells
- Identify annual hotspots based on CPUE
- Export GeoJSON, GeoPackage, PNGs, and summary tables for analysis and dashboard integration

**Outputs Generated**
- `spatial/grid_025deg_poly.geojson` — 0.25° × 0.25° polygon reference grid
- `spatial/hotspots_yearly.geojson` — yearly polygon-based hotspot layers
- `spatial/hotspots_aggregated.gpkg` — combined layers for visualization
- `spatial/qgis_project.qgz` — QGIS project file with styling
- `outputs/maps/` — PNG snapshots of key years (2000, 2010, 2011, 2020)
- `outputs/tables/hotspot_summary.csv` — yearly catch summary with CPUE

---

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

**Core Stack**
- **PostgreSQL + PostGIS:** spatial database, queries, and aggregation
- **QGIS:** visualization, layer styling, and GeoPackage exports
- **Python / Jupyter Notebooks:** exploratory analysis, temporal animations, and plotting

**Key Methods**
- Point-in-polygon spatial joins to aggregate fishing events into polygon grid cells
- Polygon-level CPUE calculated as total catch per vessel-day within each grid cell and year
- Yearly CPUE calculation
- Heatmap visualization of hotspots
- Export of canonical spatial outputs for dashboards 
- Log-scaled (base-10) graduated symbology applied at the visualization stage in QGIS to represent highly skewed catch and CPUE distributions while preserving raw values for analysis and web delivery via GeoJSON; logarithmic transformation is used solely to improve visual interpretability of highly skewed spatial patterns.

## 🗄️ Database & Workflow

This project connects to a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database using **environment variables**.  
Database credentials are **not stored in the repository** for security reasons.

**Database Design:** polygon-based aggregation prevents overlap, supports area summaries, and aligns with industry-standard workflows.

### Required Environment Variables
The following variables must be defined on your local machine before running the notebooks:

- `PGUSER` — PostgreSQL username  
- `PGPASSWORD` — PostgreSQL password  
- `PGHOST` — database host (e.g. `localhost`)  
- `PGPORT` — database port (default: `5432`)  
- `PGDATABASE` — database name  

### Example (macOS / Linux / Git Bash)

macOS/Linux(bash)
```bash
export PGUSER=postgres
export PGPASSWORD=your_password
export PGHOST=localhost
export PGPORT=5432
export PGDATABASE=your_database
```

Windows Notes

- If using Git Bash, environment variables only exist in that shell session.

 - If Jupyter is launched from Anaconda Navigator or VS Code, those variables may not be visible.

 - In that case, variables can be set inside Python for the session

   ```
    import os
    os.environ["PGUSER"] = "postgres"
    os.environ["PGPASSWORD"] = "your_password"
    os.environ["PGHOST"] = "localhost"
    os.environ["PGPORT"] = "5432"
    os.environ["PGDATABASE"] = "your_database"
    ```

Security Notes

 - Do not commit credentials directly into notebooks or scripts

 - .env files (if used) should be added to .gitignore

 - Each user must configure their own local database credential

Workflow: CSV ingestion → spatial aggregation → CPUE calculation → hotspot mapping → visualization/export.

Note on Map Symbology  
Legend values display back-transformed CPUE values (kg per vessel-day). While grid cells are symbolized using a log₁₀ transformation to handle extreme skewness, legend labels are shown in real-world units to ensure interpretability for non-technical audiences. Color differences therefore represent orders-of-magnitude changes in catch efficiency rather than linear increments.

## 📉 Limitations & Future Work

> In a consultancy or management context, understanding limitations ensures hotspot insights guide decisions prudently, rather than prompting overreaction to noisy or incomplete data.

- Polygon grid size (0.25° × 0.25°) may smooth fine-scale fishing behavios; future work could experiment with smaller grids
- Environmental drivers (SST, Chlorophyll-a, depth) not yet incorporated into predictive models — next step for integration into Streamlit/Shiny dashboard
- Future work could compare log-scaled visual hotspot patterns with alternative normalizations (e.g., effort-normalized density surfaces) to assess sensitivity of hotspot delineation.

This dataset is a simulated approximation of a real-world squid stock assessment
dataset used during my tenure as a part-time research assistant at National Taiwan
University. Although it closely resembles actual data, any interpretation or
conclusions drawn here cannot be assumed to represent real conditions in the
